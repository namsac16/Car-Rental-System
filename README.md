# Car Rental System

Car Rental System is a Project made to demonstrate the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.

This Project uses C++ Object Oriented Programming Features along with File Handling Concepts to ease data storage and retrieval.
It Provides Different Portals for Handling Admin and User Interfaces both of them who have their different roles and thus, have different options to choose from.

### Object-Oriented Concepts Used:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Abstraction (Using Class Member Functions)
- Polymosphism (Using Function Overloading)
- Encapsulation (Using Access Modifiers)
- Operator Overloading

### Other C++ Concepts Used:
- STL Vectors
- Namespace (STD)
- Preprocessor Directive (#include)
- Strings
- File Handling
- String Stream
- Date and Time Functions
